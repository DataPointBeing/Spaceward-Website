All members helped contribute to our presentation this week,
in addition to their other roles.

# Tech Progress
- Justin merged our group's branches together for our alpha
build, assisted with bugfixing (e.g. repairing a start delay-related
problem, adjusting UI component behaviors), implemented some PC animations,
and made soundscape and NPC interactivity adjustments.
- Ed implemented the new player model, but ran into some problems
making it animate due to inexperience with Unreal's animation
system. He switched his focus towards cave sub-level implementation.
- Michael assisted with packaging and testing our alpha build in preparation
for our presentation, particularly focusing on new functionality
such as the NPC character.
- Zack assisted with UI development/design, implemented pickup
messages, and worked on loading screen implementation.

# Art Progress
- Ethan assisted Michael with rigging and animating (via Mixamo) the player
character. He also modeled, textured, rigged, and animated
a (super, _super_ cool) airship from scratch, with the ability
for parts to be toggled on and off to reflect collected gears.

a spinning battery icon.
