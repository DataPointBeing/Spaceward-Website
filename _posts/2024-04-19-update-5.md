# Tech Progress
- Justin implemented the airship modeled by Ethan, added a
popup on victory, and tuned our dialogue and win condition.
He also substituted for Ethan when running playtesting.
- Ed developed a part-earning system wherein the airship
gains a new component for every 25 gears collected up to 150
(2 turbines, 2 propeller shafts, propeller beams, propeller sails),
including a  vertex/fragment reverse-dissolve shader
to create a visual part fade-in effect. He also substituted for Zack when running playtesting.

- Michael tested and deployed our completed playtest build and attended playtesting.
- Zack ran playtesting at one station, wrote our playtesting
survey, and also developed a
prototype system for handling a "cave" sub-area of the map
including camera configuration, first-pass level design
and player teleportation.

# Art Progress
- Ethan ran playtesting at one station, created a new player
jump animation, implemented Michael's repaired model and
textures (including building a new player material), and
separated the airship animation into four modules for use
next week.

- Mingliang worked on modeling a factory and attended playtesting.


- Michael repaired some skinning issues on the player
character mesh and re-exported all textures.
He also worked on the NPC character model, but has been
interrupted by a technical difficulty in ZBrush access.
