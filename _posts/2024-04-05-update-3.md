# Tech Progress
- Justin prototyped the initial gear collectible, developed
a main menu and pause menu implementation (with audio sliders),
and created an NPC with simple dialogue that the user can interact with.
- Ed created a prototype HUD, created the battery collectible,
merged the new map and meshes into the development branch, added
all batteries, gears, and bounce pads to the level, and
created the "kill volume" at the bottom of the world for
returning the player to their starting location.
- Michael tweaked air movement responsiveness, implemented
dash and double jump, made double jump and air dash
toggleable, and added a "coyote time" airjump option after
falling off a ledge.
- Zack tested out some novel camera configurations,
but placed this task on the backburner due to more pressing
work. He moved on to bounce pad implementation and created prototype
hazards that can be placed around the map.

# Art Progress
- Ethan completely overhauled the level map from scratch using rock terrain meshes, and added
splines (for pipes and tracks), unreal landscape terrain, lighting, and some decorative props.
He also finished rigging, texturing, and animating all the skeletal interactables (gear, battery, bounce pad).
